# buildtw

This is a template for a tiddlywiki plugin project. 

This project should be located in a directory representing the name of the developer,
and this will be used as part of the name for the plugin. As a default the system files 
assume a directory called 'developer' in which this project called 'buildtw' in placed (cloned)
in a directory also called 'buildtw'. Rename these to reflect you and your plugins names.

The in following files the names will need to be replaced:

readme.tid
plugin.info
tiddlywiki.files
build/bld.sh
build/demo/tiddlywiki.info
build/demoedit/tiddlywiki.info

Create a subdirectory call 'files'
Place your projects files in the 'files' subdirectory.
