You are expert in tiddlywiki. You provide solutions in wikitext.

The core concept explored is the use of the `:filter` run prefix to refine a list of tiddlers by applying a subfilter to each item. Tiddlers are kept in the list if their corresponding subfilter yields a non-empty result. This is a powerful way to filter based on conditions evaluated per tiddler while preserving the original tiddler titles in the output.

A key pattern within the `:filter` context is using the `get[fieldName]` operator. This operator retrieves the value of a specific field for the tiddler currently being processed by the subfilter. This value can then be used with operators like `compare`.

The `compare` operator is highly versatile within `:filter`. It allows comparing the value retrieved by `get` against a parameter using specified types (`date`, `integer`, `string`, `version`) and modes (`eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `gteq`, `lt`, `lteq`). This enables precise filtering based on numerical values, dates, strings, or versions stored in tiddler fields.

For example, to find tiddlers modified within a specific year, like 2024, you can combine `get[modified]` with `compare:date` in two sequential `:filter` steps:
`[all[tiddlers]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:gteq[20240101]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:lt[20250101]]`
This filter starts with all tiddlers, then keeps only those modified on or after January 1, 2024, and subsequently filters that result to keep only those modified before January 1, 2025, effectively selecting all tiddlers modified within 2024.

Filters can be chained together. An initial selection can be made using operators like `prefix[text]`, which selects tiddlers whose titles begin with the specified text. For instance, `[prefix[Hi-]]` selects all tiddlers starting with "Hi-". This initial selection can then be refined by subsequent filter steps, including `:filter` runs. Combining title and date filtering is straightforward:
`[prefix[Hi-]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:gteq[20250101]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:lt[20260101]]`
This filter successfully finds tiddlers with titles starting with "Hi-" that were modified in 2025.

Filtering based on the content of the tiddler's `text` field can also be effectively performed within a `:filter` step. Operators like `search:text[substring]` and `regexp:text[pattern]` are useful here. When placed inside a `:filter`, they check the text field of each incoming tiddler, keeping those that contain the substring or match the regex pattern.

For example, to find tiddlers modified in 2024 that contain the substring "one" in their text field, both `search` and `regexp` can be used within a final `:filter` step:
Using `search`: `[all[tiddlers]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:gteq[20240101]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:lt[20250101]] :filter[search:text[one]]`
Using `regexp`: `[all[tiddlers]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:gteq[20240101]] :filter[get[modified]compare:date:lt[20250101]] :filter[regexp:text[one]]`
Both of these filters successfully identify tiddlers matching both the 2024 modification date range and the presence of "one" in the text field, demonstrating the flexibility of using different content-matching operators within the `:filter` context.

In summary, the `:filter` prefix, combined with `get` and `compare` for field value comparisons (especially dates), and integrated with other operators like `prefix`, `search`, and `regexp` for initial selection or content matching, provides a robust method for creating precise and multi-criteria filters in TiddlyWiki. These examples show how to effectively chain filter steps to narrow down results based on title, modification date, and text content.


In TiddlyWiki wikitext, when you define a macro with parameters, you need a way to reference the value of those parameters within the body of the macro. This allows the macro to use the specific values passed to it when it's called.

Based on our conversation and the working examples we created, the syntax used to reference a macro parameter named `parameterName` within the macro definition, particularly when substituting its value into a filter expression or other wikitext, is:

`$parameterName$`

For instance, in the `listTiddlersByTag` macro we developed:

 ```wikitext
\define listTiddlersByTag(targetTag)
<ul>
<$list filter="[all[shadows+tiddlers]tag[$targetTag$]]"> ;; Referencing the parameter
<li>
<$text text=<<currentTiddler>> />: {{{[<currentTiddler>get[text]split[ ]first[10]join[ ]]}}}
</li>
</$list>
</ul>
\end
``` 

The macro is defined with the parameter `targetTag`. Inside the `<$list>` filter, the expression `[all[shadows+tiddlers]tag[$targetTag$]]` directly uses `$targetTag$` to reference the value provided when the macro is invoked.

When you call the macro like `<<listTiddlersByTag "geminiRoles">>`, TiddlyWiki substitutes `"geminiRoles"` in place of `$targetTag$` within the filter string, effectively evaluating `[all[shadows+tiddlers]tag[geminiRoles]]`. This dynamic substitution is crucial for creating flexible macros that can adapt their behavior based on the input parameters.

So, the `$parameterName$` syntax serves as a placeholder within the macro definition that gets replaced by the actual value passed during the macro call, allowing the macro's logic (like filtering) to operate on that specific value. This makes macros highly reusable for similar tasks with varying inputs.
